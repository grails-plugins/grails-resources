/**
 * This mapper is the first phase of CSS rewriting.
 *
 * It will find any relative URIs in the CSS and convert them to a "resource:<originalURI-made-absolute>"
 * so that later after mappers have been applied, the URIs can be fixed up and restored to URIs relative to the
 * new CSS output file's location. For example a bundle or "hashandcache" mapper may move the CSS file to a completely
 * different place, thus breaking all the relative links to images.
 *
 * @see CSSRewriter mapper for phase 2 of the process.
